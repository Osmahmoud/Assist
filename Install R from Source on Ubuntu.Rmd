# Install R from Source on Ubuntu

## Getting started - Remove installed R first

You are recommended to remove the already installed R version from you system. You can do a complete removal using:

```
sudo apt-get --purge remove r-base
sudo apt-get --purge remove r-base-dev
sudo apt-get --purge remove r-base-core
sudo apt-get --purge remove r-base-html
sudo apt-get --purge remove r-cran-lattice-extra
```

## Store source of R

After downloading the required source version of R (e.g., R-3.3.1.tar.gz) from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), it is recommended to copy it in the following location

```
/usr/local/src/
```

## Installing and configuring the dependencies

### The zlib package

```
cd /usr/local/src
wget http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz  # to download the package from its URL
tar xzvf zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz
cd zlib-1.2.8
./configure --prefix=$HOME/packages
make
make install
```

To adjust the environment so that R can find packages installed there, you need to do:

```
export PATH=$HOME/packages/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/packages/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
export CFLAGS="-I$HOME/packages/include" 
export LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/packages/lib" 
```
 
The first two are vital in the "make" phase of R, the latter two are vital in the "configure" phase of R.

### bzip2 package

```
cd ..                   # navigate back to the 'src' directory 
wget http://www.bzip.org/1.0.6/bzip2-1.0.6.tar.gz
tar xzvf bzip2-1.0.6.tar.gz
```
You MUST edit the `Makefile` within the directory of `bzip2-1.0.6` as follows:

Add the `-fPIC` as a CFLAG so that the defined `CFLAGS` should look like:

```
CFLAGS=-fPIC -Wall -Winline -O2 -g $(BIGFILES)
```

Then, you are ready for correct configuration of the `bzip2`. Do that using

```
cd bzip2-1.0.6
make -f Makefile-libbz2_so
make clean
make
make -n install PREFIX=$HOME/packages
make install PREFIX=$HOME/packages
```

### xz package as a recommended alternative to a separate `liblzma` package

```
cd ..
wget http://tukaani.org/xz/xz-5.2.2.tar.gz
tar xzvf xz-5.2.2.tar.gz
cd xz-5.2.2
./configure --prefix=$HOME/packages
make -j3
make install
```

### PCRE package

```
cd ..
wget http://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/pcre-8.38.tar.gz
tar xzvf pcre-8.38.tar.gz
cd pcre-8.38
./configure --enable-utf8 --prefix=$HOME/packages
make
make -j3
make install
```

### libcurl package

```
cd ..
wget --no-check-certificate https://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.47.1.tar.gz
tar xzvf curl-7.47.1.tar.gz
cd curl-7.47.1
./configure --prefix=$HOME/packages
make -j3
make install
```
## R Configuration

Now, we are ready to install and configure R source.

```
cd ..
tar xzvf R-3.3.1.tar.gz
cd R-3.3.1
./configure --prefix=$HOME/packages/R-devel '--with-cairo'  '--with-jpeglib' '--with-readline' '--with-tcltk'  '--with-blas' '--with-lapack' '--enable-R-profiling'  '--enable-R-shlib'  '--enable-memory-profiling'
```

Note that: the given options of the configure command are vital for proper R installation.

Then,

```
make
```

That should install R successfully, but ...

Now, R can be only run from its installed location `/usr/local/src/R-3.3.1/bin/R`, i.e. you should type, in terminal, `/usr/local/src/R-3.3.1/bin/R` rather than just R to execute R.

In order to be able to run R directly, and let other softwares (e.g., RStudio) to find R easily on your system, you need to check your PATH using:

```
echo $PATH
```

It usually looks like: `/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games`.

Now, one solution is to have a `symlink` of `R` and `Rscript` files into one of these path locations (say, `/usr/local/bin`). You can do so by:

```
cd /usr/local/bin
ln -s /usr/local/src/R-3.3.1/bin/R R
ln -s /usr/local/src/R-3.3.1/bin/Rscript Rscript
```

HOORAY, it finished!

Now, you can run R from terminal just by typing `R`. In addition, R studio should find and run R automatically.
